To avoid this, make sure that you always verify the number through official channels—preferably from within your IDrive account dashboard, app, or official communication. If you're not certain about the number you find, avoid calling it until you've verified its authenticity.

Depending on your subscription level, you may even have premium access to phone support, which is only visible once you’re logged into your account.
